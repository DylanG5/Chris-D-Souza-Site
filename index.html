Course on Anti-Oppression- Examining Classism, Racism, Ableism, Sexism and Heterosexism.</span> </b> This brand new text released in May 2022, is a compilation of my life's work and is designed to increase one's meta-cognition around mechanisms of power, privilege and how oppression can impact those with potentially marginalizing identities.  It can be read in a day and is divided into three parts:  1) C.R.A.S.H- which names the oppressions and includes key tenets and thought catalysts.  2). Unpacking the "B.S." in Bias which examines bias construction and de-construction and 3). Stories and events that caused me to become an equity and human rights strategist.The book is perfect for educators, managers, parents and anyone who wants to sharpen their equity lens.  It can be used a core text for book study groups as well.</p>
