        <div class="abstract-title">New for Educational, Social Service and Corporate Clients - A C.R.A.S.H. Course on Anti-oppression.</div>
        <div class="abstract-content">This brand new 120 minute workshop is based on the new book "A C.R.A.S.H. course on Anti-oppression- Examining Classism, Racism, Ableism, Sexism and Heterosexism."  Participants will be encouraged to analyze their power/privilege and/or their potential to be marginalized based on their own complex intersecting identities.  They will also be guided on an interactive journey that will explore how humans are socialized to be biased and how bias can further oppress co-workers and others within their sphere of influence.</div>

    <div class="abstract">
        <div class="abstract-title">A C.R.A.S.H. Course Part Two</div>
        <div class="abstract-content"> Leading for Equity-Using Chris's book with the same title, this workshop is a follow up to the first one and will examine systemic oppression and strategies to mitigate it within corporate and social service institutions.  Case studies will be studied to elicit strong group discussions in order to further delve into the ways that complex body identities can be included in the workspace.</div>

        <div class="abstract-title">The I.R.T. Project (Indigenous and Racialized Teachers for Leadership)</div>
        <div class="abstract-content">School boards understand that they require a greater number of teachers with Racialized and Aboriginal heritage to join the administrative ranks of these institutions  To that end I have developed the A.R.T. project comprised of a five module programme to support those teachers who self identify as such with the goal of supporting, mentoring and preparing them to become managers, consultants, department heads and/or vice principals.  The programme will focus on concepts around Critical Race Theory, Inclusive Mechanisms, The Burden of One's Representation and the Challenge of Leadership and Identity Politics. Cost TBD/Negotiated on case by case basis.</div>

    <div class="abstract">
        <div class="abstract-title">The Canadian Race Relations Foundations  "Foundations in Equity"</div>
        <div class="abstract-content">This 5 module programme (plus one on-line component), supported and managed by the Canadian Race Relations, is anchored in Critical Race Theory and is designed for school board employees at all levels of the organization.  The course is an intense immersion in equity based pedagogy, and it challenges participants to think about how their identities interact and impact with other people. (I have facilitated 15 programmes over the past four years to school boards across the GTA with rave reviews. This past June a Principal from the Grand Erie District School board stated, "that is was the best course she had ever taken in her 22 year career".)  Programmes generally run once a week for five weeks, but scheduling is flexible.  (Includes three guest lecturers and a certificate of completion for each participant).  Cost $8000.00.</div>
