          Sherwyn has been committed to working towards equity in education for
          over 30 years. His past work in the field has included numerous public
          speaking engagements, workshops, writing curriculum for the Ontario
          Ministry of Education, and co-authoring a book. Sherwyn’s work as an
          educator has taken him to 3 provinces where he’s worked in both
          private and public education. He has been an elementary and secondary
          school administrator for 15 years and currently works in the Upper
          Grand District School Board as Principal of Equity and Inclusion where
          he continues his work growing student achievement through his passion
          for equity, and excellence in instructional practice. When he is at

        <p class="text-container">
          Nathalie Sirois leads the Global Centre for Pluralism’s efforts to
          support educators and system leaders in making pluralism a lived
          experience in their specific contexts with a view to building
          inclusive societies resilient to fear and hate. She spent over 20
          years in K-12 public education in a variety of roles, including
          community worker, teacher, instructional coach, consultant, in various
          system leader roles and as an advisor and coach to senior leaders. As
          one of the first Senior Advisors for Equity, Human Rights and
          Pluralism in a French-language school board in Canada, she contended
          daily with the systemic effects of the double minoritization of
          francophone students and staff from historically marginalized
          communities. Her journey has also brought her to offer training and to
          publish various resources on trauma-informed practice for educators
          and on educational leadership. Nathalie will be running a workshop
          during the summit; "Recrutement, Rétention: Reconnaissance,
          Appartenance"

        <p class="text-container">
          Pauline is entering her third year as System Principal with the WRDSB
          after serving four years as vice principal. She joined WRDSB in 2009
          after moving to Canada from the United Kingdom, bringing a wealth of
          leadership and teaching experience, which allowed her to lend these
          diverse experiences, skills and perspectives to her work of building
          equitable and inclusive schools within the board. Pauline was inspired
          to become a teacher when she was nine after meeting her paternal aunt,
          an elementary school teacher who was visiting with the family from
          Jamaica. This is why she believes in quality representation as a
          critical component of equitable schools and a range of lived
          experiences as essential in school leaders. Together with her husband
          of 30 years, Pauline has raised a son and enjoys time with their two
          chocolate labradors and their two cats.

          about student achievement and well-being, Truth and Reconciliation,
          Human Rights and Equity and Inclusion. She recognizes her own

          middle-class, cis-gender woman, and has experienced struggles typical
          of the lives of racialized people. Pam believes that justice matters,
          and that it matters for the success for our Black, Indigenous,
