                Nathalie Sirois leads the Global Centre for Pluralism's efforts to support educators and system leaders in making pluralism a lived experience in their specific contexts with a view to building inclusive societies resilient to fear and hate. She spent over 20 years in K-12 public education in a variety of roles, including community worker, teacher, instructional coach, consultant, in various system leader roles and as an advisor and coach to senior leaders. As one of the first Senior Advisors for Equity, Human Rights and Pluralism in a French-language school board in Canada, she contended daily with the systemic effects of the double minoritization of francophone students and staff from historically marginalized communities. Her journey has also brought her to offer training and to publish various resources on trauma-informed practice for educators and on educational leadership. Nathalie will be running a workshop during the summit: "Recrutement, Rétention: Reconnaissance, Appartenance."

                Pauline is entering her third year as System Principal with the WRDSB after serving four years as vice principal. She joined WRDSB in 2009 after moving to Canada from the United Kingdom, bringing a wealth of leadership and teaching experience, which allowed her to lend these diverse experiences, skills and perspectives to her work of building equitable and inclusive schools within the board. Pauline was inspired to become a teacher when she was nine after meeting her paternal aunt, an elementary school teacher who was visiting with the family from Jamaica. This is why she believes in quality representation as a critical component of equitable schools and a range of lived experiences as essential in school leaders. Together with her husband of 30 years, Pauline has raised a son and enjoys time with their two chocolate labradors and their two cats.
