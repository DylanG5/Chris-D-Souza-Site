                    Nathalie Sirois leads the Global Centre for Pluralism’s

                    pluralism a lived experience in their specific contexts with
                    a view to building inclusive societies resilient to fear and
                    hate. She spent over 20 years in K-12 public education in a
                    variety of roles, including community worker, teacher,
                    instructional coach, consultant, in various system leader
                    roles and as an advisor and coach to senior leaders. As one
                    of the first Senior Advisors for Equity, Human Rights and
                    Pluralism in a French-language school board in Canada, she
                    contended daily with the systemic effects of the double
                    minoritization of francophone students and staff from
                    historically marginalized communities. Her journey has also
                    brought her to offer training and to publish various
